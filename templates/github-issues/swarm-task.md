TIPS FOR SWARM TASKS:
1. Write as if instructing a senior developer who doesn't know your codebase
2. Be specific about acceptance criteria - they become validation checks
3. Reference existing patterns: "Follow the pattern in src/auth/..."
4. Include edge cases to test
5. Tag with priority:high or priority:low if needed
